## üßë‚Äçüíª What I Learned

This project was a fantastic learning experience, where I:

- Explored **3D web development** with Three.js and React Three Fiber.
- Mastered **component reusability** in React.
- Enhanced UX with **Framer Motion animations**.
- Adopted **Tailwind CSS** for the first time and loved its speed and flexibility.
- Optimized performance using tools like Vite.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Difficulties Faced

Building this portfolio came with some challenges, especially since it was my first time working with certain tools:

- **Adding Motions**: Integrating animations with Framer Motion was tough at first. Getting the timing and smoothness right took experimentation, but it taught me a lot about enhancing UX with motion.
- **3D Scene Setup**: Working with 3D scenes in React Three Fiber was a new frontier. Positioning objects, adjusting lighting, and syncing them with the UI was tricky initially, but I improved through trial and error.
- **First Time with Tailwind CSS**: As a Tailwind newbie, I faced a small learning curve with utility classes. However, I learned it fast, found it super intuitive, and now love how it streamlines styling.

These hurdles made me a better developer and gave me confidence in tackling new technologies.
